# Nucleotide Sequence Alignment Tool

## Overview
This program is a **local sequence alignment tool** that aligns two nucleotide sequences using the **Smith–Waterman algorithm with affine gap penalties**.  
It automatically reads two FASTA files and outputs the best alignment along with its score.

## Features
- Reads sequences from FASTA files
- Uses user-defined scoring parameters
- Implements affine gap penalties
- Prints best alignment to terminal
- Saves results to an output FASTA file
